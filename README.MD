# EZCast SNMP
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a responsive web interface to manage many EZCast Pro Sticks, with which you can deploy, manage and maintain them.
Currently we don't know exactly what the architecture will look like, but small things like the SNMP documentation of the EZCasts are already in this repository.
